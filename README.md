# Unofficial-Unstable-Unicorns
Unstable Unicorns is a dedicated deck card game designed and illustrated by Ramy Badie that was proposed on Kickstarter.[1] The goal of the game is to control seven unicorn cards by playing unicorns and upgrade cards, and inhibiting other players with downgrades and other special cards
